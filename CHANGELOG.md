>This introduces a breaking change, the `getPosition` and `onPositionChanged` properties have been replaced by methods (`getPosition([LocationAccuracy desiredAccuracy = LocationAccuracy.Best])` and `getPositionStream([LocationAccuracy desiredAccuracy = LocationAccuracy.Best])` respectively) accepting a parameter to indicate the desired accuracy.
* Updated the Android part to make use of the [LocationManager](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/LocationManager) instead of the [FusedLocationProviderClient](https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/location/FusedLocationProviderClient)
* Improved support for handling position requests that happen in rapid succession.
