# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: Geolocator

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the develop branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master, develop ]
